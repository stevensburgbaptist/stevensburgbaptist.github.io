## Our beliefs

- The Bible has God as its author, salvation for its end and truth, without any mixture of error.  Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy and is the supreme standard by which all human conduct should be tried. (2 Tim. 3:15-17)
   
- God is the one and only living and true God.  He is an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the loving Creator, Redeemer, Preserver and Ruler of the Universe. (Gen. 1:1, Rev. 22:13, 16)
   
- Man is the special creation of God, made in His own image.  By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the world, causing his separation from God.  Only the grace of God can restore the relationship between God and man. (Gen. 1:26, Rom. 3:23, 6:23)
   
- Jesus is the Christ, the eternal Son of God.  Fully God and fully man, He has reconciled God and man through His death, burial and bodily resurrection. (2 Cor. 5:18-21, John 1:1-3, 14, 1 Pet. 3:18, 1 Cor. 15:1-4)
   
- Salvation includes the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.  There is no salvation apart from personal faith in Him. (Eh. 2:8-9, Titus 3:5, 1 John 5:11-13)
   
- We adhere to the Doctrine of the Southern Baptist Convention whose Statement of Faith is known as The Baptist Faith and Message (adopted in 2000). For more details, check out The Baptist Faith and Message on the Southern Baptist Convention website.
