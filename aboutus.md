# About Us

Various missions have played important roles in the growth of our church, whether it be community outreach or service on the foreign field.  A large percentage of our families have served on short term foreign mission trips as well as supported local organizations assisting the needy

We are affiliated with the Shiloh Baptist Association, the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia, and the Southern Baptist Convention.

Stevensburg Baptist Church is located in the rural community of Stevensburg, Virginia, which is five miles east of the town of Culpeper. Situated in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains between Fredericksburg and Culpeper, it is just 70 miles southwest of our nationâ€™s capital.
