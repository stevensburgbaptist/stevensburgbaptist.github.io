The LEGO Derby is back!

Our Awana club is celebrating a new school year by bringing back the successful LEGO Derby event from the spring. Come build and race a LEGO car, have lunch with your friends, compete for prizes, and take the car home when you're done!

Space is limited to 75 racers. Registration fee will be collected day-of with additional lunches for supporting “pit crew” and parents available for purchase. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sbc-lego-derby-tickets-70615237075?ref=elink" target="_blank" style="color:#005580">REGISTER HERE</a>
